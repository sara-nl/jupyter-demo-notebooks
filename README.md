# jupyter-demo-notebooks
This is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html)Hub demonstration environment provided by SURFsara. The account you have for this environement should only used for evaluation purposes. SURFsara has the right to suspend or change this demo service at any time.

We strongly advice you not to store sensitive data in this environment.

The production JupyterHub service offered at SURFsara is a multi user Jupyter notebook environment and suitable for a single course.

**The service**
The service is managed by SURFsara. This means that we handle the underlying hardware, operating system, resource allocation (CPU, memory, storage), the JupyterHub deployment and the notebooks themselves. We expect you to provide us with software requirements and minimal hardware requirements for the notebooks. Additionally, we expect our users to manage user accounts of the environment, this entails creating/deleting user accounts for notebook users. That being said, you pay per user per month.

**Notes**
You can ask for a more customised deployment which will require more work from our side and potentially more hardware required.
We expect the lifetime of the environment to be relatively short, similar to the course length.
